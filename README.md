# My Friend Chris
My Friend Chris is a simple web based maze game.

It is a simple project for me to experiment with: 
 * JQuery
 * JavaScript canvas
 * SourceTree/GitHub

## Progress
So far a maze (with no exit) can be loaded from a bitmap image and there is logic and event handlers that lets you move Chris arround the maze.

## What's next
The two next features are map scrolling for when the map is larger than the view port and adding exits and code to move between levels.
