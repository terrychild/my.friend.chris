# My Friend Chris
My Friend Chris is a simple web based maze game.

It is a simple project for me to experiment with: 
 * JQuery
 * JavaScript canvas
 * SourceTree/GitHub

## Progress
So far I have got a simple hard coded maze (with no exit) and logic that lets you move Chris arround the maze.

## What's next
Maze maps will be defined in bitmaps, so the next step is to replace the hard coded map with a system that reads and interprets the bitmaps.
